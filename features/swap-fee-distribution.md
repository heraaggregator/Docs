# Swap Fee Distribution

Protocol's revenues from swap transactions are transferred to the Hera Treasury. AI-powered **VaultManager** handles the distribution of these revenues.

## Distribution Planning

### 30% - Ecosystem Funding

Hera's treasury project helps to develop and maintain revenue collection. It is designed to cover many facets of Hera's ecosystem.

Hera Protocol must be an absolute treasure for its survival, and this treasure must be strengthened as much as possible. In this regard, 30% of the income from the protocol earnings is transferred to the treasury to cover possible expenses and expand the Hera project.

### 20% - Marketing & Development

The expenses required for the healthy operation of the aggregator and auxiliary applications are covered. It also provides the necessary funds for marketing activities.

Hera project provides off-chain services both on the blockchain and on off-chain servers. There is a significant expense in terms of data center and processing capacity. A 20% share is taken from this distribution in order to cover the expenses and introduce it to more people.

### Buy-Back and Liquidity Provide

According to the report recommendations presented by VaultManager, Hera tokens may be subject to buybacks from the market. Bought tokens can be held in the treasury, added to liquidity or transferred to the Staking Portal.

We have programmed a unique artificial intelligence module to reduce the initiative of the team and turn their decisions into a positive direction. By making a detailed analysis about Hera Token, it reports how much buyback should be made to the team and how much it should add to the liquidity. It also instantly examines treasury resources for liquidity. These reports are presented off-chain, buyback and liquidity addition transactions are done on-chain with the VaultManager contract.

Transactions are public on the contract.

### Rewards Pool Funding

According to the VaultManager decision, a determined number of tokens are sent to the Staking Portal to be distributed to users. Protocol revenues and distribution are directly proportional. For this reason, the APR rates of staking and farming pools vary periodically.

### Periods of Distribution
