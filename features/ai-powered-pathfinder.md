# AI Powered Pathfinder

### Find the best route with | AI-Powered Pathfinder

Hera Aggregator is built on a unique architecture with a pathfinder algorithm. Our unique algorithm's structure can be developed, re-programmed, and has self-learning capabilities.

### **Features**

#### Homogeneous Liquidity

Integrating with dozens of different market models, the pathfinder ensures nearly 100% convergence on accessible liquidity sources, creating flawless routing for execution. By homogenizing liquidity, our AI core provides a seamless trading experience, ensuring optimal rates for every transaction.

#### Dynamic Routing

For the best swap execution, our pathfinder can connect directly to a single liquidity asset or integrate dozens of sources into a single route. With multihop capabilities, it can insert additional token routes between tokens, breaking down the route for greater output. It also presents you with real-time on-chain arbitrage opportunities within the route, ensuring maximum efficiency and profitability.

#### Chain Database

The Core-AI's offchain modules fetch the necessary onchain data simultaneously with chain data. Integrated market makers, liquidity models, liquidity pools, tokens, and chain data are all served on a large database, encompassing both dynamic and static data. This comprehensive database ensures that our system remains up-to-date and highly efficient, providing seamless integration across multiple blockchain networks.

#### Kubernetes Module

Employs Kubernetes for robust, scalable deployment and management of applications. This ensures that our platform remains stable and responsive, even under high demand.

### **Pathfinder Structure:**&#x20;

#### 01. Max Output Equation

A mathematical equation is created to get the maximum output from the integrated liquidity providers. The result of this equation gives the best received amount.

It creates an equation in accordance with the pathfinder route finding structure by controlling all liquidity pools. This equation is not fixed, it changes itself according to the terms and conditions. Therefore, it uses many data types as input.

#### 02. HCA Data Processing

All required data is instantly accessed and converted to High Conversion Argument (HCA). This converted data is sent to the max output equation.

The data needed to solve the equation are provided. It is then finalized using the HCA module powered by artificial intelligence. It is then forwarded to the next step to find the max output figure.

#### 03. Find All Paths

It searches and finds all possible routes between two tokens and filters out unnecessary routes by filtering within certain criteria.

Pathfinder, which is prepared to take a maximum of 5 tokens between the input token and the output token, performs a filtering to reduce the almost infinite number of outputs. It eliminates very low liquidity pools, identifies tokens that can be matched between them, and prepares them to offer a multiple path.

#### 04. Hera Pathfinder: Assemble&#x20;

All obtained data and formulas are sent to AI powered pathfinder algorithm.

All data is assembled at this stage. After many calculations and formula analysis, it brings together the scattered data and creates the data needed to confirm the swap transaction.
