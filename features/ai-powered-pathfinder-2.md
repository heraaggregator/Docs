### **Features**

#### Assembly Coding

We've employed assembly coding for router, executor, manager, and adapter contracts to ensure unparalleled efficiency. By utilizing low-level code, we streamline data transfer, fetching, and calldata creation processes.

#### Direct Data Access

When processing a token LP into the database, we access only the necessary data, eliminating redundant queries and excessive call data. This approach targets maximum speed and minimum data bytes.

#### Offchain Optimization

Offchain data prepared for onchain execution is created entirely in low-level code, minimizing byte size. This ensures that routing involves no unnecessary data, resulting in lower transaction gas costs.

#### Seamless Integration

Our optimization strategies are designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience, both on-chain and off-chain, ensuring optimal performance for all operations.
